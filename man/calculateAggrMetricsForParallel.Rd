\description{
The output is a dataframe containing the travel time, distance, total elevation gain, upward and downward slope and energy expenditure for each route.
If brouter is not able to calculate the route, all variables will be returned with the value -99. Reasons for this may be coordinates outside the downloaded segment, or too far away from any nearby road.
